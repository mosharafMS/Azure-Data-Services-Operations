# Azure Data Factory

Azure Data Factory is the cloud-based ETL and data integration service that allows you to create data-driven workflows for orchestrating data movement and transforming data at scale. Using Azure Data Factory, you can create and schedule data-driven workflows (called pipelines) that can ingest data from disparate data stores. You can build complex ETL processes that transform data visually with data flows or by using compute services such as Azure HDInsight Hadoop, Azure Databricks, and Azure SQL Database.

## Performance Monitoring
Performance Monitoring on Azure Data Factory can be done using the Built-in Monitoring [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/monitor-visually) or with Azure Monitor [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/monitor-using-azure-monitor). For Pipeline Runs and Acitivites on the pipeline, using Built-in Monitoring will suffice, however when looking for more detailed metrics around resource usage, it is recommended that Azure Monitor is used.
